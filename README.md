Creating a visually appealing and effective landing page for a health tech startup involves careful consideration of color themes, spacing, and shadows to ensure a modern and sharp appearance. Here is a detailed prompt to guide the design process:

Design Prompt for Health Tech Startup Landing Page
1. Color Theme:

Primary Color: Soft blue (#507DBC), conveying trust and calm, ideal for health-related fields.
Secondary Color: Vibrant green (#7ED957), to symbolize growth and vitality, encouraging a positive connection with health and wellness.
Accent Color: Charcoal gray (#424242), providing a sleek and modern contrast for text and important elements.
2. Typography:

Primary Font: 'Lato', sans-serif; clean and contemporary, ensures readability and modern feel.
Secondary Font: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; used for headings and key features, adding character and emphasis without compromising clarity.
3. Spacing:

General Layout: Use a grid system for balanced alignment of elements. Ensure generous spacing between sections (at least 50px) to create a breathable, open layout that doesnâ€™t feel cramped.
Padding: Standard padding around text blocks should be 20px, increasing to 30px for content within feature boxes or call-to-action areas.
4. Shadows and Depth:

Box Shadows: Use subtle shadows (e.g., box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) for cards and call-to-action buttons to give a slight elevation, enhancing the interactive feel of the page.
Hover States: Increase shadow intensity on hover (e.g., box-shadow: 0 6px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)) to provide visual feedback when users interact with clickable elements.
5. Images and Icons:

High-Quality Images: Incorporate high-resolution images that reflect the startupâ€™s health tech focus, such as medical devices, health apps, and professional healthcare settings.
Icons: Use modern, flat icons with the secondary color palette to illustrate key features and benefits succinctly.
6. Call-to-Action (CTA):

Buttons: Rounded rectangular buttons with a gradient from soft blue to vibrant green, creating a lively and inviting click point.
Text: Use action-oriented, concise text. The text color should be white to stand out against the gradient background.
7. Overall Aesthetics:

Minimalist Style: Focus on a clean interface with plenty of white space to avoid visual overload and emphasize content.
Interactive Elements: Incorporate subtle animations for scrolling and mouse-over effects to enhance user engagement without distracting from the main content.
8. Navigation:

Sticky Navigation Bar: Include a responsive top navigation bar with a reduced opacity background that becomes solid upon scrolling, ensuring accessibility throughout the page.
